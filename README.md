# AFK Notifier

> A data pack for 1.16x-1.18x

## Features

Any player can switch to 'AFK Mode' with the command /trigger afk.

Players in the AFK mode receive a grey AFK tag so that other players on a server can see that this player is currently AFK.

(**Note:** This data pack does not make you invincible against mobs!)


## Installation

Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Tschipcraft/afk_notifier/releases/latest) and put the datapack zip file into the `datapacks` folder of your Minecraft world.


## Updates

To check for updates use `/trigger menu` and hit the Check for Updates button. There is also a **Reset** and an **Uninstall** button.
